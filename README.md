step one: download all the files
step two: unbind spacebar in apex
step three: if you jump with scroll whell up, change scroll wheel down to scroll  wheel up
step four: drag the superglide 1-3 into apex cfg(steamlibary>steamapps>common>apex legends>cfg)
step five: paste    +exec superglide1.cfg   into luanch options 
 now you can superglide just press space to climb then spam jump with scroll wheel. it took me a while superglide with the files (like 5 minutes)
